After Elon Musk was severely bullied by a group of boys and became critically injured,
he was admitted to a small hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. 
His father could not afford the potentially astronomical cost of hospitalizing Elon in Pretoria. 
So he had to make a choice. 
He walked out of the hospital, lit up a cigarette and thought what should be the next move for his son.
Should he work around the clock to make more money to pay the bill?
Should he join his relatives with Elon, move to Canada and seek treatment over there? 
Tough decisions! Tough decisions!
